- [ ] wrapper to define projects
  the idea would be to define a project as a repo and a list of dependencies
  this would allow to have:
  - automatic repository initialization if it was not defined yet
  - automatic direnv/lorri setup to allow tooling to works (without docker which is a pita)
- [ ] lorri
- [ ] ssh files are hardcoded
- [ ] icons
- [ ] gnome configuration
  - [ ] gnome extensions configuration
- [ ] slack configuration
- [ ] guake
- [ ] authy

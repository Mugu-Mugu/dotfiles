- [X] discord
- [X] slack
- [ ] git for Me
- [ ] git for Wakeo
- [ ] access to github
- [ ] ssh files should be in a secret dir
- [ ] black theme
- [ ] wrapper to define projects
  the idea would be to define a project as a repo and a list of dependencies
  this would allow to have:
  - automatic repository initialization if it was not defined yet
  - automatic direnv/lorri setup to allow tooling to works (without docker which is a pita)
- [ ] lorri
- [ ] icons
- [ ] gnome configuration
  - [ ] gnome extensions configuration
- [ ] slack configuration
- [ ] guake
- [ ] authy
- [ ] firefox should have a preinstallation of bitwarden or bitwarden as standalone

* TODO [#D] Bootstraping should include a bootstrap script for nix
* TODO [#D] Bootstraping should also clone the repository in a predefined location

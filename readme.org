* Overview
This is my home setup defining my tools along with their configuration. Hopefully, this will allow me
to setup a reproducible working environnement on several machines (home, work, etc.)

The configuration is split along several profiles:
- bootstrap when installing on an empty machine
- base with a configuration designed for hobby software developpment
- various work configuration

Profiles may include sensitive information and secrets that are encrypted with [[https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt][git-crypt]].

* Getting started

** Bootstrap home-manager (exemple for Ubuntu)
#+begin_src bash
# Install curl
sudo apt install curl

# Install home-manager and the bootstraping env
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mugu-Mugu/dotfiles/master/bootstrap_ubuntu.sh | bash

# Install the master gpg key with the tool provided in the bootstraping env
# gpg --import {private key location}

# Unlock the repository
git-crypt unlock

# Activate the default profile
hm_switch base
#+end_src


** Finalize installation
Sadly not everything can be controlled and automated by home-manager. There are some manual operation left:
- change the default shell
  #+begin_src sh
  sudo chsh -s $(which zsh)
  #+end_src
- [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods][install docker]] and [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/][configure]] so it so it may be used without sudo
- configure Firefox
  - synchronize it
  - reactivate some features
    - activate bookmark toolbar visibility
    - reset the theme if needed
    - restore the default font to ~Deja Vu Serif~
- configure tools which does not document a dotfile
  - slack
  - discord
  - etc..

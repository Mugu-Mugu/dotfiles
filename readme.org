* Overview
This is my home setup defining my tools along with their configuration. Hopefully, this will allow me
to setup a reproducible working environnement on several machines (home, work, etc.)

The configuration is split along several profiles:
- bootstrap when installing on an empty machine
- base with a configuration designed for hobby software developpment
- various work configuration

Profiles may include sensitive information and secrets that are encrypted with [[https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt][git-crypt]].

* Getting started

** Bootstraping (exemple for Ubuntu)
#+begin_src bash
# Install curl 
sudo apt install curl

# Install home-manager and the bootstraping env
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mugu-Mugu/dotfiles/master/bootstrap_ubuntu.sh | bash

# Install the master gpg key with the tool provided in the bootstraping env
# gpg --import {private key location}

# Unlock the repository
git-crypt unlock

# Activate the default profile
home-manager switch --flake ./#base
#+end_src

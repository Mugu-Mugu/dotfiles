* Overview
This is my home setup defining my tools along with their configuration. Hopefully, this will allow me
to setup a reproducible working environnement on several machines (home, work, etc.)

The configuration is split along several profiles:
- bootstrap when installing on an empty machine
- base with a configuration designed for hobby software developpment
- various work configuration

Profiles may include sensitive information and secrets that are encrypted with [[https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt][git-crypt]].

* Getting started

** Bootstraping (WIP)
#+begin_src bash
# Install home-manager (for instance on a ubunut system)
./bootstrap_ubuntu.sh # or copy/paste it

# Install the bootstraping home-manager environment
home-manager switch --flake ./#bootstrap

# Install the master gpg key

# Unlock the repository
git-crypt unlock

# Activate the default profile
home-manager switch --flake ./#base
#+end_src
